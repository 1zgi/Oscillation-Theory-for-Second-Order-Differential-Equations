# Oscillation Theory for Second-Order Differential Equations

## Introduction
This thesis explores the question: **“Will the solution curves of a linear second-order ordinary differential equation continue crossing the x-axis, or will they eventually remain on one side?”**  
The analysis is focused on the Sturm–Liouville form:

-(p(x) y′)′ + q(x) y = 0

and builds upon the classical developments from Sturm’s foundational 19th-century work through to advanced criteria formulated in the 20th century.

## Concepts

* **Oscillatory vs Nonoscillatory (Disconjugacy)** – Describes whether a solution has infinitely many zeros or not.
* **Sturm’s Separation Theorem** – Details the interlacing behavior of zeros between two independent solutions.
* **Sturm’s Comparison Theorem** – Compares the zero counts of two equations by evaluating their coefficients.
* **Sturm-Picone Comparison Theorem** – Generalizes Sturm’s theorem by accounting for different leading coefficients.
* **Leighton’s Comparison Theorem** – Offers a broader zero-comparison framework using an integral identity.
* **Leighton’s Criterion** – Establishes an integral condition that ensures oscillation occurs.
* **Kreith’s Criteria** – Uses quadratic-integral conditions to test for disconjugacy.
* **Levin’s Comparison Theorem** – Applies a Riccati transformation to estimate zeros without needing a direct comparison equation.
* **Wintner’s Criteria** – Provides conditions based on integral growth at infinity to determine oscillatory behavior.
* **Hartman’s Criterion** – Identifies the exact threshold between oscillatory and nonoscillatory behavior.

## Motivations & Applications

* **Structural vibration** – Helps predict node positions and natural frequencies in beams, strings, and membranes without solving the complete eigenvalue problem.
* **Electrical and mechanical oscillators** – Evaluates whether systems will exhibit sustained oscillation or quickly settle.
* **Quantum mechanics** – Connects the count of bound states in a potential well to the zeros of associated wavefunctions.
* **Rapid qualitative analysis** – Equips science and engineer students with fast, coefficient checks for system stability and resonance.
